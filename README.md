# BLU-E

Own experimental frontend framework (runtime).

I have no very viable or notable features, used by own projects.

## Notable features

- Better memory managment
- Cache and reaction system
- Low level (DOM managment)
- Better CSS compatible
- Web components compatible
- Experimental Typed OM
- Mutation Observer (attributes)
- Input changes `value` key to reactive

## Unknown features

- I have no viable ideas about MutationObserver DOM tree features, same as Intersection Observers.
- I don't know how to use [Web Animations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API) in context of that framework.
- I would somehow implement animation-specific features, but current don't know how it can be implemented, and doesn't know viable conceptions.
- Also I would to implement scroll-driven animations (timelines) and animation worklets, but also have no any viable ideas.
- Have very weak ideas for ResizeObserver's.

## Dependency

- [`Object.TS`](https://github.com/unite-2-re/object.ts) most notable.
- [`DOM.ts`](https://github.com/unite-2-re/dom.ts) DOM utils (may be appear).

## Interaction

- [`Existence.TS`](https://github.com/unite-2-re/existence.core) visible or hidden control.
- [`Agate.UX`](https://github.com/unite-2-re/agate.ux) honestly, not remembers.
