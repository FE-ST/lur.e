### ðŸ”Œ API ðŸ”Œ

Shortly, most notable **core** concept.

- `E(Element|Selector, { attributes: {}, dataset: {}, style: {}, ... }, children[] | mapped)`
   - create DOM element with nodes
- `M(Array|Set, generateCb)`
   - make mapped elements from array
- `H(DOMCode)`
   - create static DOM HTML from code
- `L(String|StringRef)`
   - make TextNode object

## *Plans*

- I have no viable ideas about MutationObserver DOM tree features, same as Intersection Observers.
- I don't know how to use [Web Animations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API) in context of that framework.
- I would somehow implement animation-specific features, but current don't know how it can be implemented, and doesn't know viable conceptions.
- Also I would to implement scroll-driven animations (timelines) and animation worklets, but also have no any viable ideas.
- Have very weak ideas for ResizeObserver's.
